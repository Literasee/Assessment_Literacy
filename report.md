## Section 1: Assessment Literacy Essentials

Educators frequently conduct assessment activities, such as developing 
or selecting assessments to administer to their students, in order to 
determine what the student knows and can do. What do we mean by "assessment"? 
Broadly, assessment is defined as “the process of collecting, synthesizing, 
and interpreting information to aid (educational) decision making” 
(Russell & Airasian, 2011). In this guide, the terms “assessment” and 
“test” are often used interchangeably to denote an instrument used in 
assessment, such as a performance exam or a paper-and-pencil test.  

### Part 1. Defining Assessment Literacy and Technology Literacy

In order for teachers, specialists and support professionals, building 
administrators, and central office administrators to effectively use systems 
like ET&L for assessment and reporting to make educational decisions, a basic 
level of understanding regarding assessment construction and use 
(“assessment literacy”), as well as a level of comfort with the use of 
technology (“technology literacy”) is helpful for getting the most out 
of the process.   

#### What is Assessment Literacy?
W. James Popham, author of many books and articles on testing, teaching, and 
what teachers and administrators need to know about testing, offers the 
follow definition of assessment literacy:

> Assessment literacy consists of an individual’s understandings of the 
> fundamental assessment concepts and procedures deemed likely to influence 
> educational decisions.
>
> W. James Popham, 2012

Whether the focus is on making instructional decisions for individual students 
or program decisions for schools of districts, educators use assessments to 
gather data to support those decisions.  High quality assessments and 
reporting practices provide relevant and accurate data that enable teachers 
and specialists interacting with students to

- diagnose student needs prior to instruction,
- check in on student learning in the midst of instructional lessons or units,
- evaluate student learning at the end of instructional lessons or units, and 
- determine how well individual students are progressing through the curriculum.

Building and central office administrators may be more focused on the interpretation and use of aggregated assessment results to 
 - monitor student progress across classrooms, grades, and schools,
 - monitor the proportion of students attaining designated benchmarks,
 - gauge the effectiveness of specific instructional or curricular programs, and
 - evaluate academic policies.
 
####Primary Principle of Assessment Literacy

 > Form Follows Function

Assessments that provide relevant and accurate data for one purpose might not provide the data needed for another purpose. The state assessment that produces estimates of a student’s level of proficiency may produce data needed to support administrators’ decisions about the effectiveness of a particular program, but might provide little information useful to diagnose an individual student’s specific instructional needs. Similarly, an assessment designed to provide diagnostic information to inform instruction for an individual student is not likely to provide the breadth of information needed to evaluate academic policies or measure progress toward school and district goals. 

Basic assessment literacy provides educators with the understandings needed to develop and select, from a range of practices, assessment tools that match their intended purposes. 

####Assessment Literacy Categories in This Guide

Assessment literacy information is grouped, in Section 2 of this guide, into three categories:
 - 1.	Developing and selecting assessment items
 - 2.	Developing assessments
 - 3.	Working with assessment results (producing, reporting, and interpreting)
