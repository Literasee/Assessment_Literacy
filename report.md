## Section 1: Assessment Literacy Essentials

Educators frequently conduct assessment activities, such as developing 
or selecting assessments to administer to their students, in order to 
determine what the student knows and can do. What do we mean by “assessment”? 
Broadly, assessment is defined as “the process of collecting, synthesizing, 
and interpreting information to aid (educational) decision making” 
(Russell & Airasian, 2011). In this guide, the terms “assessment” and 
“test” are often used interchangeably to denote an instrument used in 
assessment, such as a performance exam or a paper-and-pencil test.
